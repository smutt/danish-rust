.SH NAME
danish \- Middle-box DANE for HTTPS.

.SH SYNOPSIS
danish [-c|--chain top_chain] [-h|--help] [-s|--sub-chain]

.SH DESCRIPTION
Danish is an experiment in middle-box DNS-Based Authentication of
Named Entities (DANE) for HTTPS. 

Danish is a daemon that listens for HTTPS TLS handshake traffic and
captures the TLS/SNI and certificates. It then performs DNS lookups
for DNS TLSA records to determine if the responding server is sending
the correct X.509 certificate in its TLS ServerHello message.

If the certificates and DNS TLSA records do not match,
iptables/ip6tables ACLs are installed to block user traffic to the
offending website. ACLs are installed to both blackhole the immediate
TCP traffic and prevent any further attempts at users connecting to
the offending website. Users are then prevented from connecting to the
offending website.
